# Frontend Assessment


## Problem

- Build a single-page web application using React JS that allows users to look up current
- weather information for cities around the world and add cities to a “favorites” list.

## Requirements

- Use a real-time world weather API service such as weatherstack.com.
- By default, users should be shown a list of the 15 largest cities in the world by population in alphabetical order and - the current temperature for each. Users should be able to remove these entries individually from the list to clean it up.
- Clicking on a city in the list should open a page where the user can see more weather information. This view should - include a textarea field where the user can enter and save notes. Users should also be able to edit and remove notes.
- Users should be able to use a search field to look up weather details for other cities.
- Users should be able to add/remove cities as “favorites” which will appear at the top of the list on the home screen - (also in alphabetical order).
- Except for the “search” feature, the app should retain basic functionality offline. The most up-to-date information - should be cached and persist in local storage.
- The program should be built entirely as a front end application. There should be no back-end or database (use only local - storage).
- Ask the user for permission to get their current location and open the details page for their city after they grant it.
- Functionality should be appropriately divided into well-defined components.
- Include unit testing for applicable functionality.
- The application should have a production-ready clean/modern aesthetic. Creatively stylize the elements as you see fit, - but do not use a UI framework (i.e. - Material UI, Semantic UI, React Bootstrap, etc.)
